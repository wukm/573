For convenience, all code and related material for this course (apart
from certain files like pdf or other large binary blobs) will be hosted on

general TODOs
-------------

There are ways to manage versions of packages of software in python so that the
appropriate software can be obtained and used along with the appropriate
version of python and any required packages without requiring global
installation. I plan on setting this up with the current code base at some
future point. This is a work in progress. 

"Fix" use of matplotlib, either directly or via a wrapper.
