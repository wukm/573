Math 573 Homework #2, Question 2(a)

Solve a symbolic(!?) non-linear system of equations
via Newton's method.

all right, buckle the fuck up

GENERAL NOTES:

*   note that python is 0 indexed, so f_1 is actually accessed as F[0]
    internally. shouldn't really matter but hey

*   holy shit, error handling, what is all this nonsense

*   sympy.sympify uses eval() so santitize input

*   to evaluate a component F[i] for some particular \vec{x}, you can do the
    following:

    F[i].subs((x,xi) for x, xi in zip(X, (3,4,5)) # for example

    i.e. this will return the value of f_{i+1}(x) when x=(3,4,5).T
    
    this works for quick evaluation, but for any extended use, it's way more
    favorable to use sympy.lambdify(x, expr, "numpy"). see docs

*   note that all sympy expressions are immutable (like strings)

*   turn this into a class or sumit?

    INPUT

    F_strings:  an iterable of n strings, each of which refers to up to
    n symbolic variables in an internally consistent way.
    F_args: a (comma or whitespace) delimited string containing the n symbolic
    variables used in F_strings

    OUTPUT
    
    the system F which is totally cool

    NOTES:
    
    *   you should actually bundle all of the parsing and such in a separate
        function, like "get_shit()" and "build_jacobian()" etc.

    *   symbolic input kinda works as expected, i guess? check for bugs. i know
        for a fact that curly brackets '{','}', etc. are a no-go, so it's not
        *exactly* latex syntax.
