The included scripts were written in a scientific python environment.

Output as shown in the report was generated using the following software:

    python 3.4.3-3
    python-numpy 1.9.2-2
    python-scipy 0.16.0-1
    python-matplotlib 1.4.3-2

However, any version of python3.x with compatible versions of
numpy,scipy,matplotlib should be sufficient. There are many convenient methods
of obtaining these packages as a bundle (at least within a UNIX environment).
Moreover, these scripts should be more-or-less compatible with a python2.x
environment, although no such guarantees are made.

There are ways to manage versions of packages of software in python so that the
appropriate software can be obtained and used along with the appropriate
version of python and any required packages without requiring global
installation. I plan on setting this up with the current code base at some
future point. This is a work in progress. 

Lastly, for convenience, all code and related material for this course (apart
from certain files like pdf or other large binary blobs) will be hosted on
https://www.github.com/wukm/573.
